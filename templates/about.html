        <p>
            My name is Rob Cutmore. I'm a software developer located in Upstate New York.
            I currently work predominantly with Python and refactoring (and replacing) legacy 
            Visual Basic and VBA code. Much of my programming experience from work involves 
            process automation and data analysis. I started this website to work on my web 
            development skills and to eventually display a portfolio of programming projects.
