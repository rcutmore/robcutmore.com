This is the project for my personal website. It's a Django project including
apps for a simple blog and portfolio. Blog posts and portfolio projects can be
written in Markdown. Blog and portfolio lists can be filtered by various tags.
Tag filtering utilizes Ajax calls by default but also works when JavaScript is
disabled.

There is an Ansible playbook available [here](https://github.com/rcutmore/robcutmore.com-setup) for setting up a server to run this project.
